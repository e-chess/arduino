<h4 align="center">Usage</h4>
<p  align="center">1. Upload and run the code "send" on an Arduino Mega (needs many pins) which is connected to the capacitive sensors <a href="https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense">(Arduino Library)</a>.</p>  
<p  align="center">2. Upload and run the code "receive" on another Arduino, which is connected to the LEDs <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel">(Arduino Library)</a>.</p>
